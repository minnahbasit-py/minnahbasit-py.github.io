	<p>The website is going to be a videogame landing page specific to my experience and streaming</p>
	<p>Personalized streamers website about videogame Apex Legends</p>

	
	<p>This is intended for new players of the game, people interested in streamers gaming clips, and for apex legends team as I will include critiques of the game as a day 1 player</p>

	<p>
	- I want the design to have a futuristic theme and gaming look to it</p>
	<p>My color scheme will be the basic apex colors:<p>
		<ul>
			<li>#B93038</li>
			<li>#A4373D</li>
			<li>#F97B2E</li>
			<li>#E3DFD6</li>
			<li>#3A401A</li>
		</ul>
